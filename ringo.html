			Ringo

		<body>
Born is Georga he grew up in a junk yard and was one of a gang of cats who lived there. When he was still young he got attacked by another cat and is now blind in one eye. He was sent to a shelter to be fixed up, saddly it was a kill shelter and he was deemed "undisirible". Luckly there is a non-profit that offten addopts cats in kill shelters and transports them up nouth to no kill shelters. That is where I found him and was happy to take him home.

Ringo is a Siberian cat, this is a breed that comes from Russia. They are one of the largest cat breeds only following MainCoons. Due to Ringo bring a mix he is not as large as they come but is certaly one of the longest cats I have seen.
